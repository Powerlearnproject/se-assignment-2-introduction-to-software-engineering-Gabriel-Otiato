Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering the discipline of designing, developing and maintaining software systems through the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools. This is done to ensure the reliability, efficiency and maintainability of software products through its life cycle.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering the discipline of designing, developing and maintaining software systems through the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools.

It differs from traditional programming in some several ways incliding;
i). Scope - software engineering entails the entire process of software system's life cycle whereas traditional programming involves writing codes to solve a specific problem or perform a task assigned to the code. 
ii). Objectives - Software engineering aims at providing software that can help solve long term human needs whereas traditional programming aims at code development to solve an immediate problem or perform an immediate task. 
iii). Methodology - in software engineering, methodology is structured and best practices such as agie, DevOps, scrum and waterfall are used while traditional programming follows less formal/ad-hoc approaches to coding.
iv). Roles and their collaboration - software engineering involves specialised roles such as software architects, project managers, quality assurance engineers and business analysts and also requires coordination different team members. On the other hand, traditional programming is performed by individual developers and the need for much cordination and role specialisation is limited.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
This is the process followed by a software developer while making/developing software products.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software Development Life Cycle includes;
i). Coming up with a plan of which user need you want to meet or a problem you want to solve.
ii). Gathering the requirements for the project (these requirements are based on the user needs and system requirements).
iii). Coming up with a design. This is done through system architect as well as user interface.
iv). Implementation by writing a code and building the software according to the user interface.
v). Testing the software to ensure its working well and it is upto the right standards.
vi). Deploy the system for users to use it and solve the needs. 
vii). Maintainance of the system by supporting, updating and enhancing the system.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 
Agile is a model used in software development that involves iterative and incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaborative and development in responding to change. while using Aigle, one can complete another step even before finishing another step and thus making it very flexible for long term projects. 
Waterfall on the other hand is a sequential approach that requires a developer to finish one face before going to the other. This is good while developing a system that won't take long since it goes step by step and when one step fails the whole process has to be repeated. 

Both  Agile and waterfall are commonly used software development methodologies. Agile is mostly used for projects with changing requirements, complex and uncertain projects, innovation-driven projects. Waterfall, on the other hand is used for projects with specific stable requirements, projects that need a well documented audit trail ad projects with fixed scope and budget.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirements for a software system.
The process includes;
i). Gathering the neccesary requirements from stakeholders through surveys, interviews and workshops. 
ii). Requirements analysis. These requirements are analyzed for consistency, completeness and feasibility. 
iii). Requirements specification by documenting them in a clear manner.
iv). Requirement validation by review of the documented information together with the stakeholders to ensure it has adressed the needs.
v). Requirement management. This involves management of changes in the requirement throughout the lifecycle. 

importance of requirements engineering in SDLC.
i). It increases the likelihood of the success of the project by ensuring the software aligns to the needs of the stakeholders. ii). Helps to reduce risks by identifying and addressing requirements earlier in the development process. iii). It is highly cost saving as well as time saving since rework and costly changes later on are avoided. iv). Ensures that final product meets the desired quality standards. v). It leads to overall customer satisfaction by proper incorporation of the needs and expectations of the stakeholders into the software system.


Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is a principle that helps create a software in a way that minimizes dependancy aong the components of a system by coming up with modules that can interact with one another through well defined interface.

Modularity increases maintainability and scalability in many ways;
i). Ease of understanding by breaking down the system into modular components.
ii). Ability to reuse the code by allowing modules to be used across the different parts of the system or different projects.
iii). It is easy to make changes because they are isolated through the formulation of different modules where developers can update individual modules.
iv). It enables easy scalability since additional features can be added  by introducing new modules incase of growth in the system.
v). Modular design allows for independent testing of modules making it easier to identify and fix defects early in development process.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

i). Unit testing - This is testing individual components of a software to verify that each unit behaves as expected and meets its requirements.
ii). Integration testing - This focuses on the interaction between different unit of components of a software to ensure correct flow of data.
iii). System testing - This evaluates the whole software to ensure it the integrated system meets its specified requirements and functions correctly.
iv). Acceptance testing - This is a test done to to confirm if the software meets te acceptance criteria defined by the stakeholders in order to meet user needs.


Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are software tools that enable developers to manage changes to source code, documents and other files over time. Examples include; git, version control, gitlab, concurrent version system Bit keeper, e.t.c.

It is important in software development in several ways;
i). History tracking. VCS maintains a detailes history of changes made on the project including time made and whoever made. This makes it easy to track the information.
ii). VCS integrates seamlessly with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines. this enables automated testing and deployment of code changes.
iii). VCS enables code review by allowing the developers to share their changes with teammates for review and feedback, this helps improve in quality and identity.
iv). VCS enables developers to create branches to work on new features or experiment with changes without affecting the main codebase.
v). VCS serves as a backup mechanism for project files, this is because even accidentally deleted files can be traced and restored from VCS repository.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Roles of a software project manager include;
i). Creating plans and scheduling effective timelines.
ii). Facilitating communication among members, stakeholders and clients.
iii). Leading and motivating the project team to achieve project goals,
iv). Managing the project budget and ensuring resources are used effectively,
v).  Quality assurance to the final product.
vi). Problem solving during project lifecycle.
vii). Drcision making on the basis of project goals, constraints and available resources.
Challanges include;
1. Changes in project scope leading to delays and increased costs.
2. Limited resources which causes a challange in meeting project objectives.
3. Poor communication among the team members that lead to misunderstandings.
4. Stake holders expecations that are sometimes too hard to meet.
5. Changing requirements in the project can require adjustments to timelines.
Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process by which a developer changes, modifies and updates software to keep it up tp date with customers needs.

Types of maintenance activities;
1. Corrective maintenance: this aims to restore software working state by fixing bugs and defects found after deploying a software.
2. Adaptive maintenance: this involves updating the software in order to accomodate the changes in the sorrounding environment.
3. Perfective maintenance: this are changes that are meant to improve the performance of a software, usability and other non functional attributes.
4. Preventive maintenance: this involves addressing available problems in a system before time in order to prevent future problems. 

Why maintenance is essential:
i) Allows for the adaptation of the system to meet changing requirements.
ii) To enable bug fixing.
iii)To ensure the software remains up to date with the volving technology.
iv) Helps to address system vulnerabilities and protect from cyber threats.
v) Enhances value and competitiveness of the system.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues software engineers face;
1. Privacy concerns because a developer may come up with a system that stores information that might raise privacy concerns, so it is important to learn how to handle sensitive infromation.
2. Security of the system is ethical issue so as to avoid cybercrimes and threats.
3. Transparency on how system works and accountability for their designs and choices.
4. Environmental impact since software engineers have to minimize damages on the environment when coming up with these systems/
5. Potential social impact on the people i.e it might lead to unempoyment.

   Software engineers need follow these guidelines to ensure they adhere to ethiccal standards;
   - Educate themselves on ethical principles, codes of conduct, and legal regulations relevant in their field.
   - Ethical decision making even when caught up in ethical dilemas,
   - Privacy protection by implementing strong data protection measures, obtaining consent for data collection and minimizing collecting unnecesary information.
   - Transparency and accountability in the work.
   - Collaboration and communication with collegues and, users and stakeholders to discuss ethical concerns and solutions.
   - Continuous improvement by evaluating ethical standards and seeking feedback from peer and mentors.
